# A1: Digi2 Research Lab

Digi2 focuses their work on advanced systems and control concepts, tools and technologies for a wide range of areas encompassing cyber-physical systems, collaborative robotics, machine learning and human-machine interaction with high societal impact.

Digi2 seeks creative and disruptive researchers to enroll their poll of R&D projects ranging from cyber-physical systems to artificial intelligence.

This revamp aims to give more functionalities to the Digi2 Researchers, namely:

- Inventory Managment
- Communication Platforms Access
- Better Community Comunication
- More Accessible UI

The Users can register an account on the platform and be able to log in as Authenticated Users.

Authenticated Users will be able to browse normally through the website and also interact with job applications. They will have access to a profile which houses their personal information, profile picture, social media links, and research links.

The System Administrator(s)/Moderator(s) will be able to make regular Authenticated Users into fellow Researchers and also create new Projects. These Projects will have dedicated pages with the project description, resource and communication links and more.

Any Researcher or System Administrator will have access to the Inventory and will be able to manage it. They will also have access to communication tools which will let them communicate with the whole University of Porto Comunity.

The platform will have an adaptive, responsive design to allow it to work smoothly on multiple devices (desktop, smartphone, etc...) as well as an intuitive user interface and navigation.
