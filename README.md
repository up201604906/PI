# How to Run
In order to run the website, you will need to open 2 separate terminals: 1 for the client side and another for the server side. 

After navigating to the respective directories, first run `npm start` in the server terminal, and then in the client terminal.

In order to seed the database, you just need to run `npm run seed` while inside the server directory. The seeder database is located on the `/server/seeders/seed.js`.
